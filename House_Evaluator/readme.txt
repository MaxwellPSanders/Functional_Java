This functional program gets 2 files read in that represent Houses and all of the details associated with them, and Zip code and how nice it is to live there.

The program reads in those two files into arraylists, and through the magic of Functional Java processes the data into two different files.

HouseAveragesByZip.txt is a tab delimited text file that holds the average house details of all the houses in a specific zip code.

HouseOrderByRating.txt is a tab delimited text file that holds the house details of the houses that are worthy of being considered to be bought for renting later out.

The rest of the questions should be answered by the comments in the code.

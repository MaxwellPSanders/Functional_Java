This file is the same as city_county and county
except that it has one more level of abstraction

Now the program will take the type of zip code and
use that as another form of distinction within the city

Beyond that it only prints the county and city name once per
city-county key pair, and also only prints out the full city
population for each city key pair, this program does not 
print out the county population
